🇨🇳 Slide 7: Can They Be Friends Again?

Main Idea:
This slide explores the India–China relationship — complex, competitive, and cautious. It asks whether two rising Asian powers can rebuild trust after years of tension.

Explanation:

India and China share not just a border but centuries of cultural and trade ties — from the Silk Route to Buddhism’s spread. Yet, modern politics has turned neighbors into wary rivals.

The key tension comes from border disputes, especially in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. The 2020 Galwan Valley clash — where soldiers from both sides lost their lives — broke decades of peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

Economically, though, they remain deeply interlinked. China is still one of India’s largest trading partners, supplying everything from electronics to industrial machinery.

The relationship is like a see-saw — cooperation in trade and global climate forums, but competition in defense and geopolitics.

Both countries are aware that conflict hurts growth, so diplomacy remains active through border talks and regional platforms like BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).

Example to Mention:

Even after the Galwan incident, India and China continued joint participation in BRICS summits, showing “cold peace” diplomacy — they won’t be friends soon, but they also can’t afford open hostility.

India’s ban on 200+ Chinese apps (including TikTok and PUBG Mobile) was a symbolic move — asserting digital sovereignty while maintaining trade pragmatism.

Engaging Analogy:

“It’s like two roommates who argue daily over space but still share the same Wi-Fi — they can’t ignore each other entirely.”

🤝 Slide 8: Upping the States

Main Idea:
This slide emphasizes how India is strengthening its international partnerships and taking a proactive diplomatic stance — not as a follower, but as a strategic player shaping the new world order.

Explanation:

“Upping the States” means upgrading India’s role in the state system — the network of global powers.

India’s foreign policy has shifted from non-alignment (during the Cold War) to multi-alignment — building partnerships with many nations while keeping autonomy.

The most visible move: India’s participation in strategic alliances like the QUAD (India, Japan, U.S., Australia). QUAD focuses on ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, countering China’s growing influence in the region.

India is also deepening ties with Europe (EU FTA talks), Middle East (I2U2 group – India, Israel, UAE, U.S.), and Africa (development projects).

These alliances help India in three ways:

Security: Joint defense exercises (e.g., Malabar naval drills).

Technology: Collaborations on AI, semiconductors, and clean energy.

Investment: Attracting FDI for infrastructure and manufacturing.

Examples to Mention:

India and Japan’s cooperation on the Mumbai–Ahmedabad Bullet Train project shows how partnerships can boost development while maintaining sovereignty.

India hosted the G20 Summit in 2023, positioning itself as a voice for the Global South — a bridge between developed and developing nations.

Engaging Analogy:

“If global politics is a chessboard, India is no longer just a pawn — it’s becoming a player setting its own strategy.”
